## Hi there üëã
### My name is Alejandro  
Full Stack Developer with a background in Architecture, blending creativity and technical expertise to create exceptional digital experiences. My current focus lies in JavaScript technologies, particularly NodeJS, Express, TypeScript, React, Redux, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. Additionally, I've been also exploring Angular, Redis and GraphQL.

I've always been interested in coding and software development during my career, having the chance to work in multidisciplinary teams and dynamic environments, where effective communication and problem-solving skills were key to deliver succesful projects.

Passionate about new technologies and good design, I enjoy writing clean and organised code that facilitates seamless collaboration within my team. I thrive in an efficient, collaborative environment where everyone's input is valued.

Beyond the scope of computing, I like taking care of my well-being through mindful eating, regular exercise, and a love for exploring new places through travel.

üåç I'm currently based in Barcelona  
‚ö° I'm currently improving my knowledge in Redux  
ü§ù I'm looking to collaborate on Full Stack projects
