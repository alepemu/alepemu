## Hi there üëã
### My name is Alejandro  
Currently specialised in JavaScript technologies using NodeJS, Express, Koa, TypeScript, React, Redux, Mongo and SQL. I have also been learning different programming languages like Python and C.

I studied Architecture but I have always been interested in coding and software development. As an architect, I have experienced working in multidisciplinary teams where a good communication and the ability to solve
problems across the different stages of a project are key to deliver a succesful work.

Passionate about new technologies and good design, I enjoy writing clean and organised code that my team can easily understand. I love working in an efficient collaborative environment where everybody can take part.

Far from the computer, I like taking care of my wellbeing, eating healthy, exercising regularly and travelling to new and unknown destinations.

üåç I'm currently based in Barcelona  
‚ö° I'm currently improving my knowledge in Redux, Redis and GraphQL  
ü§ù I'm looking to collaborate on Full Stack projects  
üí¨ You can contact me at apenalvermunita@gmail.com
