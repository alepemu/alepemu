## Hi there üëã
### My name is Alejandro  
I studied Architecture in the university of Granada, but I've always been interested in coding and software development. I've been learning different programming languages like Python, JavaScript and C. Currently specialised in JavaScript technologies using NodeJS, Express, Koa, TypeScript, React, Redux, Mongo and SQL among others.

As an architect, I have worked on multidisciplinary teams where a good communication and the ability to solve problems across the different stages of a project, from early design to a more technical development and construction, are key to deliver a succesful work.

Passionate about new technologies and good design, I enjoy writing clean and organised code that my team can easily understand. I love working in an efficient collaborative environment where everybody can contribute.

Far from the computer, I like taking care of my well-being, eating healthy, exercising regularly and travelling to new and unknown destinations.

üåç I'm currently based in Barcelona  
‚ö° I'm currently improving my knowledge in Redux  
ü§ù I'm looking to collaborate on Full Stack projects
